4The data structure can be built from <link> and <node> data

in the file.

<node id= lat= lon= >

Node is a point with (x,y) coordinates (lon,lat) which means longitude latitude.

id is an assigned integer that identifies the node. Not all nodes are part of the

path network, but that does not matter.


<link id= node= node= >

Link is a segment of a path defined by nodes at each end. The node id's given

are used to identify the coordinates from the <node > structure.

Other tags:

veg= define whether there is vegetation on that link, eg. trees, flowers, grass

arch= defines whether there is important architecture on that path

length= defined the path length that could be a curved path and longer than              the straight-line distance between the 2 points


Other data is defined in that file, but can be ignored for the project.

<way> is defined as a set of links that make up a path.

<geom> is a set of nodes that define a shape, for example a building.


Output could be a set of points that define a path that can be

visualised on a map.
